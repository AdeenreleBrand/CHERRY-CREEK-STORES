## Problem Statement
For this business problem presented by the manager of cherry creek super stores, they are entering a new 
business year and based on the stores performance in the previous years, they want to know if they are segments, 
months, years, products they should pay more attention to.
They'll like my insights regarding the data and i came up with this questions;
1. Total profit by segment and category?
2. Sum of sales sold in each year?
3. The region with the highest profit?
4. The month with the highest sales? 
5. The no of quantities sold for each sub-category?
6. The discount for each segment with the highest and lowest discount?

## Skills/ Steps Demonstrated 
- Import data; first we need to import and understand the dataset.
- Data cleaning: ﻿﻿As a good example, the date values are currently text (string), sometimes in universal or 
US format. We need to standardize the format, then change the type to date type.
﻿﻿Replace every "Central" to "North" in region column,simply delete the incomplete rows, no blanks.create a threadline
for order date for the last 5 years using the text function repeat same process for months.

## Conclusion/ Recommendation;

I performed a superficial analysis here... And you're right!
In real life, we would need to answer every additional question we found during the exploratory analysis, 
and probably more topics to analyze once all the said questions are answered. Finally, excel is a great tool to dive into dataset,
and it provides robust andeasy-to-use dashboard for end users.
